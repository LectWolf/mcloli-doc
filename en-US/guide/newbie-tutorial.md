# Newcomer's Guide

Welcome to DreamCloud! We have prepared the following content to help you quickly get started in the DreamCloud world.

Experienced players who frequently play on the server can skip this!

## Preparation Before Joining the Server

### Install Java

Minecraft Java Edition is written in Java, so your computer needs a Java environment to run Minecraft.

You can find the Java installation package in the group files. Download and install it to set up the Java environment. The server version is `1.20.1`, which requires `Java 17`.

### Download the Client

You have the following options:

- Download `DreamCloud Client.zip` from the group files, unzip it, and open `Launch Game.exe`.

- Download `DreamCloud Import Package.zip` from the group files, and drag it directly into launchers that support mcbbs import packages like `HMCL`, `PCL2`, etc.

- Use any `1.20.1` client directly to join.

### Join the Server

::: danger Notice
Player names must be 3-16 characters long and can only include English letters, numbers, and underscores.

They must match the regular expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.

After completing the above steps, you can join the `DreamCloud` server through `Multiplayer`.

If `DreamCloud` is not listed in `Multiplayer`, you can `Add Server` and enter the server IP, `mcloli.cn`, to join the server.

### Registration and Premium Login

::: tip Premium Login

In most cases, premium users do not need to register or log in.

If registration is required, please follow the non-premium login process to register.

In the lobby, type `/premium` to join the premium list.

Next time you log in, you won't need to enter a password.

::: tip Non-Premium Login

Use the command `/reg password password` to register your game name.

If you encounter a message prompting you to log in without having registered, it means the account has already been registered.
