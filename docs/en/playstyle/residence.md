### Create Territory

First, find an area where you want to create a territory. Use a `wooden hoe` to select two opposite points by left-clicking and right-clicking with the mouse.

You will receive the following prompts:

- Selected the first point at X:** Y:** Z:**
- Selected the second point at X:** Y:** Z:**

After selecting the area, you can use `/res create TerritoryName` to create the territory.

### Set Territory

Enter `/res set` in the territory to modify its related settings.

### Expand Territory

In the territory you want to expand, face the area you want to expand to and input `/res expand Size`.

This will expand your territory in the direction you are facing.

::: danger Note
There must be an 8-block distance between territories.

If the expansion area is adjacent to other territories, it cannot be expanded.
